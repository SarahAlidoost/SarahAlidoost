## About me

I am a software engineer in environmental and sustainability domains, as well as a researcher in Geomatics and Remote Sensing. 
I am experienced in statistical modeling, data processing, and software engineering, 
with expertise in machine learning, optimization, and simulation techniques, and with an interest in interdisciplinary collaborations.

An overview of the projects and software I have contributed to is available [here](https://research-software-directory.org/profile/0000-0001-8407-6472/projects).
